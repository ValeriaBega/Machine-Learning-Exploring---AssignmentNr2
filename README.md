## Question 1: Grid search, KNN, SVM and Ensembles
1. Using grid search and your selected metric, find the best hyperparameters for two models: SVM and
KNN. Briefly describe how you selected the hyperparameters and their values for grid search.
2. Combine the SVM, KNN with the best parameters, and a decision tree model with default parameters,
into a voting classifier. Evaluate its performance.
3. Train a random forest model and evaluate its performance
